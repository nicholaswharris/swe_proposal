				<h1>About The Project</h1>
				<p>
					<strong>A neural network application for categorizing
						different fruits within an image and identifying their ripeness.</strong>
				</p>
				<p>Users will be able to submit any image to the application,
					which will then identify fruits the image may contain. The type,
					ripeness, and approximate quantity of visible fruit will be given
					to the user.</p>
				<p>The application will be accessible to users through a web UI,
					to which users may upload an image and receive a list of fruits the
					image contains, along with information about it.</p>

			<h1>Feasibility Analysis</h1>
			<h2>Technical Feasibility:</h2>
			<p>To create this project, the team will need software,
				package-managers, programming libraries, and a sizeable dataset of
				pictures containing a variety of fruits. A CUDA-capable GPU is
				optional but highly recommended as it can drastically improve
				performance. All of the required materials can be sourced on the
				Internet at no cost to the team or prospective clients. GPUs with
				CUDA capability cost anywhere from $200 (for used or older models)
				to over $10,000 (for newer, high-end models).</p>

			<h2>Financial Feasibility:</h2>
			<p>All the resources for this project, aside from time, are
				readily available with no cost to team or prospective clients. In a
				real-life scenario, this would be different. The project would need
				to include the pay-rate for the team, cost of necessary hardware,
				cost of necessary software (if commercial license is necessary), and
				the cost of installation. Additionally, rates would need to be
				established for any extra time and materials initially unforeseen.</p>

			<h2>Organizational Feasibility:</h2>
			<p>Team consists of 6 members with experienced Computer Science
				backgrounds. Each member has different areas pertinent to the
				project where they excel. Collectively, the team has experience with
				GitHub, Python, Java, C/C++, Web Development, Project Management,
				and Software Engineering. Every aspect of the project falls within
				the range of the group.</p>
